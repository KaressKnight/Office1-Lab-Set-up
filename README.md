# Office1-Lab-Set-up
Demo-Set up-Accounting office
Follow me on my journey to becoming a Security Engineer!

This is a project in class I am working on this week. The objective/ assignment is to create a Network configuration model for 1 of 2 scenarios. 
Scenario given: Small business - Small Accounting firm - create a written explaination and create a diagram. 
#Please, I encourage for any feedback and assistance if you notice anything that I maybe missing. I am grateful to be alive and able to learn. Thank you

Start up: Hardware
RJ-45 Cables are the standard cabling, so I chose for this type of cables for my network 
Devices: Servers; Router; Switches; Monitors and external devices such as a scanner and a printer, and a phone. 

For this model the set up is for a small office, including the devices needed listed above. With the standard security and resource sharing needs. I chose to go with a local access network (LAN) and this means that this network is in a relatively smaller location. LAN can be quite big and if you joing mulitiple LAN will create a WAN(wide access network), but for this model we are going with a local access network. 
Topology: The network topology is a star topology to the best of my knowledge, however when I look over my diagram it looks like a mesh topology, however not all the devices have a line to each one another. So, I went with the Star topology. 
Device Summary:
1 Server – Configuration: E-mail/Mail. 
To provide the employees in the office to communicate with through being able to send messages to each other and clients.  
1 Server – Configuration: Web/Internet. 
To provide online access to new customers and webpage for the business. 
1 Server – Configuration: Database. 
To manage the client information and to assist in organizing large amounts of data. 
1 Server – Configuration: File Server 
To manage files and make it easier to share and retrieve files that are saved to the drive. 
1 Router – for big networks there could be a seperate DHCP server, however for small networks like this one, I learned that there are routers that have the DHCP function installed(Routers_DHCP).  
Cabling: 	RJ-45 ethernet cable is going to be the best the line to connect these devices. The 	reason being that it is designed to be the standard primary connection for servers, routers, 	and switches. There are different categories to consider as well, however we are going to 	stick to the CAT6 standard.  
Conclusion:  
[Check out the other attachments to look at the diagram and configuration file.] The small office network model describes hopefully the way the diagram is shown. I'll have to admit that I think I forgot something, but I tried not to forget anything... It should show create a reliable and secure system for connectivity, communication, and resource sharing. A star topology and including setting the router with IP address give a pinpoint location (unique identifier) between connections. For devices such as servers and router are given statice IP addresses to set an 'adress pool', If i am saying it right. DNS is “numbers meets words” this is significant for the business to connect to the webserver and resolving how to navigate to the company’s site. Server and client needs  for a central system to provide messaging, saving files, or keep data organized. VPN does encrypt connections for users to work in a virtually, for instance to act as if your in the office, but I feel like this scenario didn’t really need for a VPN unless I was adding a laptop for her when she is not in the office. Firewalls put in place to manage and avoid the threats from coming in through the network, rules are applied, and the firewalls help protect both servers and clients. LAN is the design for it being in a small location.
